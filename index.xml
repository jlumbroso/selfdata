GitHub is a website and service that allows people to store and share their code online. It&amp;rsquo;s often used by developers, but anyone can use it to create and share their own projects, or to contribute to other people&amp;rsquo;s projects. Think of it like a virtual library for code, where you can store and retrieve different versions of your code, collaborate with others, and even track issues and bugs.</description></item><item><title>About this site</title><link>https://selfdata.princeton.edu/page/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>lumbroso@princeton.edu (Jérémie Lumbroso)</author><guid>https://selfdata.princeton.edu/page/about/</guid><description>This site was created by Jérémie Lumbroso.
He fell in love with programming, computers and data when he was 2 years old, learned how to read/write for the specific purpose of programming at age 6, and has never looked back—and he cares deeply about any obstacle in the path of newcomers to programming, which he thinks should be accessible to all.
This site seeks to introduce newcomers not just to programming but to how beautiful and significant it can be to have data about yourself, when you are in control.</description></item></channel></rss>
